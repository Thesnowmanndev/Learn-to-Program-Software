# Welcome to Learn Python created by Kyle Martin | https://github.com/Thesnowmanndev This repository is mainly for my
# notes while learning how to program in python. Feel free to read over the files in this repository and learn what
# you can. I will try to leave as detailed notes in a comment form as I can but if you are new to programming dont
# get in the habit of making 100s of comments. Strive to have clean readable code that doesnt require comments to
# explain what it does. That will make you a better developer in the long run.

# IMPORTANT: This is a more advanced document of Strings in Python. I recommend you look over /Basics/SimpleStrings.py
# first before you learn this file.

# There is a lot of handy things you can do with strings in Python. For starters all strings are arrays. What is an
# array? An array is simply a list of data. An array is also known as a data structure (a structure that holds some
# data together).
