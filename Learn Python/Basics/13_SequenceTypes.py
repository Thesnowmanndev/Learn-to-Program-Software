# Welcome to Learn Python created by Kyle Martin | https://github.com/Thesnowmanndev | This repository is mainly for my
# notes while learning how to program in python. Feel free to read over the files in this repository and learn what
# you can. I will try to leave as detailed notes in a comment form as I can but if you are new to programming dont
# get in the habit of making 100s of comments. Strive to have clean readable code that doesnt require comments to
# explain what it does. That will make you a better developer in the long run.

# Sequence Types in Python:
# Python has 5 sequence types built in. They are The string, list, tuple, range, and byte / bytearrays
# A sequence is an ordered set of items. For example:

greeting = "Hello World!"

# The string above is a sequence. It is an ordered set of items each being the characters in the string. 
# A list is also a sequence type:

equipment_needed = ["computer", "monitor", "keyboard", "mouse", "cords"]

# The list above is a sequence type, it contains 5 items each being a string. 



if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(equipment_needed)
