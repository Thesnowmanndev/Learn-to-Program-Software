Python Basics: (This file was written in notepad with word wrap on)

Welcome to Python Basics! My name is Kyle Martin. My goal with this github repository is to log my journey of things I have learned in python and hopefully a beginner to the Python language will find this and learn a few things. You will see a plethora of .py files. Feel free to create a fork of this repo, open up the .py files, and change somethings. The only way you are going to learn is if you mess with the code and learn what happened when you run the file or see if you get a error. Please read this readme entirely before you start as I have set it up to help you learn the best ways and truly memorize how python works. A little about me. I have been messing around with coding languages since ~2007 and I really never have stuck to one nor have I made big applications. Why? Because I wasn't serious about learning how to code. That all changed. I have been an aircraft mechanic for a decade now and a aircraft maintenance instructor for around 2 years (as of 2020). If I make it another 10 years in this career and retire then I would like to become a software engineer. Hopefully before I retire from aircraft maintenance. If you relate to my story at all then perfect! We have common ground. If not, well, hopefully my files and comments can still help you learn a few things! Regardless thank you for checking out my repo. 

IMPORTANT: When you see 'IMPORTANT' in various .py files please make sure you read it and understand what I have wrote. Not every .py file will have a important comment but I still suggest reading the comments I have placed in the files.

IMPORTANT: When I first started learning how to code in the python language I was using an IDE. After watching a video posted on YouTube by Tech by Tim he brought up the point why you would want to learn how to code by not using an IDE. Why? Because IDEs make it easy. Humans tend to always lean towards what is easiest at the time, or the path of least resistance. But it can severely hinder you from TRULY learning how to program. All of the code completion features or suggestions take away from retaining the little nuances of a language. So when you are following along with your course, or a video, try not to use an IDE like they suggest. Instead use notepad or notepad++. Ever since I swapped over to notepad++ and running my files in the terminal myself I started to really learn the syntax of the language. I suggest you do the same. At times in your college courses or coding interviews you will be asked to write code without an IDE (yes typically you would use an IDE on the job as it helps immensely) but it tests how much you really do know about a language, and if you cant display that you know the basics or you struggle fixing something simple it could cost you a high paying job. So try using Notepad++ until you are more advanced with any programming language. Just make sure you go to settings > preferences > Auto Completion > Uncheck enable Auto Completion that way notepad doesn't try to predict every word you are typing.

How to run a python file in terminal (cmd) or powershell 
1. First navigate to the folder structure with the python file you would like to run. You can do this a number of ways. 
	- Start > Run > CMD (press enter) type CD (directory) : for example 'CD D:\Programming\Learn-to-program-software\Learn Python\Basics\
	- Start > Run > powershell (press enter) type CD (directory) : for example 'CD D:\Programming\Learn-to-program-software\Learn Python\Basics\
	- Open up the chosen folder and at the top you will see something like 'D:\Programming\Learn-to-program-software\Learn Python\Basics\' highlight that by clicking once and type in powershell or cmd and hit enter
2. type 'python filename.py' and hit enter. Example: python HelloWorld.py
	- A cool feature is typing in 'python first three characters of file' and hit tab. Example python hel 
	- You should see it autocompleted to 'python .\HelloWorld.py' simply hit enter and it will run that file
