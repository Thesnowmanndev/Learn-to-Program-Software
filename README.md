# Order of navigating /Learn Python/Basics/ folder:
##### Read over the files in this order until you fully understand what the file would result as a application. Feel free to fork and tinker with the code as you see fit. Afterall, the only way you will truly understand a language is if you read and write it. Please do not skip over README_FIRST.txt as it will cover some important topics. At the end of some python files I will link relevant links to questions posted on HackerRank to challenge what you have learned so far. You are not obligated to complete them but I would strongly suggest them.
1. README_FIRST.txt
2. HelloWorld.py
3. SimpleStrings.py
4. StringEscapeChars.py
5. BasicUserInput.py
6. Expressions.py
